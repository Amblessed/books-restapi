This project is a Spring Boot application that provides a REST API for managing books. The application provides several endpoints for performing CRUD operations on books. The API testing was done using Python requests library with pytest framework.

## Features

| HTTP Method | Endpoint    | Description                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GET         | /books      | Retrieve books. Accepts query parameters: `title`, `author`, `category`. Any combination of parameters is allowed. |
| POST        | /books      | Create a new book.                                                                                                 |
| PUT         | /books      | Update a book by `title` (query parameter only).                                                                   |
| PUT         | /books/{id} | Update a book by ID.                                                                                               |
| DELETE      | /books      | Delete a book by `title` (query parameter only).                                                                   |
| DELETE      | /books/{id} | Delete a book by ID.                                                                                               |


### Notes:

- **GET /books**: Flexible querying. Examples:
   - `/books?title=Book1` ‚Üí Get by title
   - `/books?author=Author1&category=Fiction` ‚Üí Get by author and category
   - `/books` ‚Üí Get all books

- **PUT /books and DELETE /books** by title require exactly one title query parameter.
